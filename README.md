This app will change the icon files (app.ico) of the discord desktop app. To regain the original icon look in the archive folder inside Content folder.
Use this to prank your friends and family.
This works on any version of Discord. I think...
Just make sure Discord is located in C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Discord.

Enjoy.
